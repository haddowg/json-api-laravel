/**
 * The package's fill of core's {@see RelationshipCountInterface} count seam: a
 * render-time lookup over a map the
 * {@see \haddowg\JsonApiLaravel\DataProvider\RelationCountBatcher} pre-computed for the
 * fetched page of parents, so the per-relationship `meta.total` core renders for a
 * `?withCount`-named countable relation reads a batched count rather than triggering a
 * per-object query.
 *
 * The map is keyed by the parent's object identity ({@see \spl_object_id()}) then by
 * relation name, because the very object instances the batcher counted are the ones the
 * serializer renders (the response value object holds them) — so the lookup needs no
 * wire-id re-resolution and is exact even for two distinct parents that happen to share a
 * wire id across types. A parent/relation absent from the map (not counted, or not a
 * countable `?withCount` relation) returns `null`, and core then omits `meta.total`.
 *
 * Injected per request through core's {@see \haddowg\JsonApi\Server\Server::withRelationshipCount()}
 * (via the swappable {@see RequestScopedRelationshipCount} holder, since the Server is
 * immutable and memoized), so a built map lives only for the render of the page it was
 * built from.
